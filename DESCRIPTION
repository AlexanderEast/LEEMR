Description: Lorber-Egeghy Method of exposure analysis, as described in Egeghy & Lorber:
              "An assessment of the exposure of Americans to perfluorooctane 
              sulfonate: a comparison of estimated intake with values inferred from 
              NHANES data"(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20145679/)and Lorber & Egeghy:
              Simple intake and pharmacokinetic modeling to characterize exposure of Americans to 
              perfluoroctanoic acid, PFOA(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21517063/)
